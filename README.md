Kindly find our code here.<br> 
 
 
The code discribed here was originally developed by Vasilis Kontis and colleagues (available from https://github.com/vkontis/maple), due to the updated dependent package (R-INLA software), previous work cannot be used directly, so we made some modifications to the previous code to make their package work agian.
 
We want show our greatest thanks for previous work.
